1. Include jQuery in your page.

3. Include jPlayer in your page

2. Include the plugin javascript and css file.

3. Build your playlist. The playlist uses the same format s jPlayer (an array of objects. However, this plugin requires
   you to add some additional parameters. A sample playlist item:

   {
		mp3:'mix/1.mp3',
		oga:'mix/1.ogg',
        rating:4.5,
        title:'Some song title',
        buy:'http://www.codebasehero.com',
        price:'0.99',
        duration:'4:28',
        artist:'Artist Name',
        cover:'images/cover.jpg'
	}

4. Initialize the plugin:
   $('body').ttwMusicPlayer(myPlaylist, {options});

   You can specify the following options in the options object:

   {
        currencySymbol:'$',
        buyText:'BUY',
        tracksToShow:5,
        autoPlay:false,
        ratingCallback:function(index, playlistItem, rating){
                //some logic to process the rating, perhaps through an ajax call
        },
        jPlayer:{} //override default jPlayer options here. This accepts the same structure as the standalone jPlayer
   };
